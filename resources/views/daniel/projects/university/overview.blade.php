        <h2>Tank Wars</h2>
        <p>
            Tank Wars was developed in C for the <i>Programming Language I</i> course of my bachelors degree at
            <abbr title="Faculdades Associadas de SÃ£o Paulo">FASP</abbr>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Directly write to the video memory to render the graphics.</li>
            <li>Each player (up to 6) controls a tank.</li>
            <li>On each turn the player must choose a weapon before shooting, each weapon has a different cost.</li>
            <li>Before shooting the player must select the appropriate fire power and shooting angle.</li>
            <li>Some weapons are affected by wind while others are not.</li>
            <li>The terrain is modified by the blasts or explosions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shaders Programming</h2>
        <p>
            Those images were created using <strong>C# XNA</strong> and
            <strong>shaders</strong> running on the <strong>GPU</strong>, as part of the
            <i>Game Programming</i> course of my masters degree at
            <abbr title="University of Technology Sydney">UTS</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shaders were used to dynamically render light projection and
            shadows from one or more light sources.
        </p>
        {!! PhotoSwipeHelper::generatePictures(
            '100x75', 'images/daniel/projects/University/', [

                ['shaders-03', 'Shadow casted from different lights sources.', '800x600'],
        ]) !!}

        <h2>OpenGL Terrain and Pattern Generator</h2>
        <p>
            Those images were created using <strong>OpenGL</strong> as part of
            the <i>Computer Graphics</i> course of my masters degree at
            <abbr title="University of Technology Sydney">UTS</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The terrain is 3D (can be rotated).
            The images are randomly generated and can produce different results
            of the same pattern if different random seeds are provided.
        </p>
        {!! PhotoSwipeHelper::generatePictures(
            '100x75', 'images/daniel/projects/University/', [

                ['opengl-03', 'A random pattern generated using similar techniques.', '616x636'],
        ]) !!}

        <h2>3D Rigging and Animation</h2>
        <p>
            The rendered images were created using <strong>Maya</strong> as part of
            the <i>Advanced 3D Computer Animation</i> course of my masters degree at
            <abbr title="University of Technology Sydney">UTS</abbr>.

        <h2>Ray Tracing</h2>
        <p>
            The following images were rendered from my own ray tracer software,
            developed in C++ as part of
            the <i>Advanced Image Synthesis Techniques</i> course of my masters degree at
            <abbr title="University of Technology Sydney">UTS</abbr>.

        <h2>Green Kangaroo - iPhone Game</h2>
        <p>
            As part of the <i>Mobile Game Development</i>
            course of my masters degree at
            <abbr title="University of Technology Sydney">UTS</abbr> we developed
            a few game prototypes and Green Kangaroo was later published at the Apple Store.

        <h2>Sounds from Heaven - Research Project</h2>
        <p>
            This prototype was used as part of my masters research project
            <i>Drum Tutoring Software: Finding approaches to improve the learning experience.</i>.
