		<h1>Hardware</h1>
		<p>
			Here we show all parts of the controller hardware, trying to explain in details
			how it works, allowing people to better understand it and/or help us improving it.
		</p>

		<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
		<p>
			Using a LM7805, this part of the circuit lowers the input voltage to a regulated 5V supply.
		</p>

				the KK1 connector.

		<h3>USB Controller</h3>
		<p>
			The USB controller uses an FT232RL IC to provide serial communication.
			Both the FT232RL and the ATMega328 are powered using the USB supply, not
			the external supply.

			Arduino.
		</p>

				between the serial communication line with the FT232RL (safety resistor).

		<h3>Sensors Connectors and Relay Expansion Connectors</h3>
		<p>
			The connectors to the sensors provide 5V and GND in case the sensors need them.
			The reed switches are passive (unpowered), therefore they do not use the 5V.
		</p>
		<p>
			The connector to the expansion relays board is a simple conector to control more 4 relays,
			allowing the expansion of the track from 4 lanes to 8 lanes.
		</p>

			The race lights circuit converts 2 bits to four light states:
			off, one red, two reds and two greens.
			It may be used not only for the race start, but also to show when the race is paused.

		<h3>Race Light ICs</h3>
		<p>

			unused gates' pins, since these TTLs provide more logical gates than we needed.

				track (T) and accelerator (A).
