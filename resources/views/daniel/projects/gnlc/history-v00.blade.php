	<h3>Version 0.0: LDR sensors + LPT port</h3>
	<p>
		In 2006 my father <a href="mailto:afonso@roperto.net">Afonso</a> gave me a lap counter made with LDR
		(light dependent resistor) sensors glued underneath the slot car track, connected
		directly to a computer's LPT (parallel port).
		
		He asked me to try installing the track so we could set up a championship amongst our family.
		When I couldn't make the software to work properly, I've decided to assemble a new piece of 
		software compatible with those sensors, but the whole system was way too unstable for me
		to use it in our races.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even though I have no records of those hardware and softwares, the positive outcome
		I've got from that was the willing to better understand electronics, at least enough to
		enable me to create a similar system that could work properly; however, only four
		years later I managed to put some time into that project, when I finally got a working prototype.
